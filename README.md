Demographic Data Analysis (with Jupyter Notebooks)

This is a Jupyter Notebook version of the same problem I uploaded a few minutes before in Python. Whereas that one was created in repl.it with all its packages, this one is easier to follow as it looks cleaner and in bits.

It is a project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer) to practice data analysis with pandas, as well as reading csv files.
So far it has very basic Markdown as I am still on my way of learning it in Jupyter Notebooks; however I might be adding a few things to hone up on that.

This version answers the 9 questions posed by the project, and I might be adding some more exploration to practice other pandas features.
